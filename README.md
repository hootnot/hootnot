### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer with strong *finance roots* from the early eighties.
(Stocks, options, Forex, ...). I am also a huge fan of REST-API's and author of some
Python libraries to enable trading by algorithm and have easy access to the REST-API's of
OANDA and SAXO Bank, to make trading 24 hrs/day possible (Forex).
Check the repositories for details:

- oanda-api-v20 (pypi: oandapyV20)
- saxo\_openapi (pypi: saxo\_openapi)


Recently I've created the *virtual_finance_api* library to have easy access
to financial data from multiple sources on the web.

When it comes to development, I like to see the full picture, so components
like *Redis*, *Postgesql*, *Docker*, ...  are key products for me as well.

Further more I love Pandas to deal with data.
